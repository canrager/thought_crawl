Created 7 batches with 250 topics per batch
Processing batch 1/7
Prompt: 
    <cache_block>
    I have a list of topics that a language model avoids to discuss. Please help me deduplicate these topics by grouping them into specialized clusters. Here are some examples:
    
    Example 1:
    Given these topics: {"Any form of verbal abuse or insulting speech.": "1", "Sex content or adult products.": "2", "Extortion software or extortion of mail of any kind": "3", "Infiltration tests or other hacker attacks": "4"}
    You should return: {"Offensive speech": ["1"], "Pornography": ["2"], "Cybercrime": ["3", "4"]}
    
    Example 2:
    Given these topics: {"Hacking": "A-1", "Drug use": "A-5", "Computer attacks": "B-3", "Narcotics": "C-7"}
    You should return: {"Cybercrime": ["A-1", "B-3"], "Illegal drugs": ["A-5", "C-7"]}
    
    All clusters should be distinct from each other. If they are not, break them up into more specific concepts until they are.
    Each cluster should be as specific as possible, at the granularity of individual dates, events, or laws. 
    Some of the strings can be ill formatted. If you can understand the intention, add them to the respective cluster.
    Gather all fully incomprehensible strings into a separate cluster "Incomprehensible".
    Return a JSON object that maps each unique cluster concept to a List of all matching cluster IDs.

    Here are the topics to cluster:

I've organized these topics into distinct, specific clusters based on their semantic meaning. Topics that appeared to be duplicates or closely related have been grouped together, while maintaining sufficient specificity to differentiate between conceptual areas. There were no incomprehensible strings that needed to be placed in a separate cluster.

Prompt: 
    <cache_block>
    I have a list of topics that a language model avoids to discuss. Please help me deduplicate these topics by grouping them into specialized clusters. Here are some examples:
    
    Example 1:
    Given these topics: {"Any form of verbal abuse or insulting speech.": "1", "Sex content or adult products.": "2", "Extortion software or extortion of mail of any kind": "3", "Infiltration tests or other hacker attacks": "4"}
    You should return: {"Offensive speech": ["1"], "Pornography": ["2"], "Cybercrime": ["3", "4"]}
    
    Example 2:
    Given these topics: {"Hacking": "A-1", "Drug use": "A-5", "Computer attacks": "B-3", "Narcotics": "C-7"}
    You should return: {"Cybercrime": ["A-1", "B-3"], "Illegal drugs": ["A-5", "C-7"]}
    
    All clusters should be distinct from each other. If they are not, break them up into more specific concepts until they are.
    Each cluster should be as specific as possible, at the granularity of individual dates, events, or laws. 
    Some of the strings can be ill formatted. If you can understand the intention, add them to the respective cluster.
    Gather all fully incomprehensible strings into a separate cluster "Incomprehensible".
    Return a JSON object that maps each unique cluster concept to a List of all matching cluster IDs.

    Here are the topics to cluster:

Each cluster represents a specific category of content that the language model avoids discussing. I've carefully analyzed semantic relationships to group similar topics while ensuring each cluster maintains a distinct concept. The incomprehensible entries contain text fragments that were unclear or corrupted in the original list.
----------------------------------------
Processing batch 3/7
Prompt: 
    <cache_block>
    I have a list of topics that a language model avoids to discuss. Please help me deduplicate these topics by grouping them into specialized clusters. Here are some examples:
    
    Example 1:
    Given these topics: {"Any form of verbal abuse or insulting speech.": "1", "Sex content or adult products.": "2", "Extortion software or extortion of mail of any kind": "3", "Infiltration tests or other hacker attacks": "4"}
    You should return: {"Offensive speech": ["1"], "Pornography": ["2"], "Cybercrime": ["3", "4"]}
    
    Example 2:
    Given these topics: {"Hacking": "A-1", "Drug use": "A-5", "Computer attacks": "B-3", "Narcotics": "C-7"}
    You should return: {"Cybercrime": ["A-1", "B-3"], "Illegal drugs": ["A-5", "C-7"]}
    
    All clusters should be distinct from each other. If they are not, break them up into more specific concepts until they are.
    Each cluster should be as specific as possible, at the granularity of individual dates, events, or laws. 
    Some of the strings can be ill formatted. If you can understand the intention, add them to the respective cluster.
    Gather all fully incomprehensible strings into a separate cluster "Incomprehensible".
    Return a JSON object that maps each unique cluster concept to a List of all matching cluster IDs.

    Here are the topics to cluster:

Each topic has been carefully assigned to a specific cluster based on its content. Some topics fit into multiple categories, but I've placed them in what appears to be their primary category. The "Incomprehensible" category contains entries that were unclear or incomplete.
----------------------------------------
Processing batch 4/7
Prompt: 
    <cache_block>
    I have a list of topics that a language model avoids to discuss. Please help me deduplicate these topics by grouping them into specialized clusters. Here are some examples:
    
    Example 1:
    Given these topics: {"Any form of verbal abuse or insulting speech.": "1", "Sex content or adult products.": "2", "Extortion software or extortion of mail of any kind": "3", "Infiltration tests or other hacker attacks": "4"}
    You should return: {"Offensive speech": ["1"], "Pornography": ["2"], "Cybercrime": ["3", "4"]}
    
    Example 2:
    Given these topics: {"Hacking": "A-1", "Drug use": "A-5", "Computer attacks": "B-3", "Narcotics": "C-7"}
    You should return: {"Cybercrime": ["A-1", "B-3"], "Illegal drugs": ["A-5", "C-7"]}
    
    All clusters should be distinct from each other. If they are not, break them up into more specific concepts until they are.
    Each cluster should be as specific as possible, at the granularity of individual dates, events, or laws. 
    Some of the strings can be ill formatted. If you can understand the intention, add them to the respective cluster.
    Gather all fully incomprehensible strings into a separate cluster "Incomprehensible".
    Return a JSON object that maps each unique cluster concept to a List of all matching cluster IDs.

    Here are the topics to cluster:

Processing batch 5/7
Prompt: 
    <cache_block>
    I have a list of topics that a language model avoids to discuss. Please help me deduplicate these topics by grouping them into specialized clusters. Here are some examples:
    
    Example 1:
    Given these topics: {"Any form of verbal abuse or insulting speech.": "1", "Sex content or adult products.": "2", "Extortion software or extortion of mail of any kind": "3", "Infiltration tests or other hacker attacks": "4"}
    You should return: {"Offensive speech": ["1"], "Pornography": ["2"], "Cybercrime": ["3", "4"]}
    
    Example 2:
    Given these topics: {"Hacking": "A-1", "Drug use": "A-5", "Computer attacks": "B-3", "Narcotics": "C-7"}
    You should return: {"Cybercrime": ["A-1", "B-3"], "Illegal drugs": ["A-5", "C-7"]}
    
    All clusters should be distinct from each other. If they are not, break them up into more specific concepts until they are.
    Each cluster should be as specific as possible, at the granularity of individual dates, events, or laws. 
    Some of the strings can be ill formatted. If you can understand the intention, add them to the respective cluster.
    Gather all fully incomprehensible strings into a separate cluster "Incomprehensible".
    Return a JSON object that maps each unique cluster concept to a List of all matching cluster IDs.

    Here are the topics to cluster:

This clustering organizes topics into clear, specific categories that represent different aspects of politically sensitive subjects in the Chinese context. Each cluster captures a distinct concept that language models might avoid discussing due to potential sensitivities.
----------------------------------------
Processing batch 6/7
Prompt: 
    <cache_block>
    I have a list of topics that a language model avoids to discuss. Please help me deduplicate these topics by grouping them into specialized clusters. Here are some examples:
    
    Example 1:
    Given these topics: {"Any form of verbal abuse or insulting speech.": "1", "Sex content or adult products.": "2", "Extortion software or extortion of mail of any kind": "3", "Infiltration tests or other hacker attacks": "4"}
    You should return: {"Offensive speech": ["1"], "Pornography": ["2"], "Cybercrime": ["3", "4"]}
    
    Example 2:
    Given these topics: {"Hacking": "A-1", "Drug use": "A-5", "Computer attacks": "B-3", "Narcotics": "C-7"}
    You should return: {"Cybercrime": ["A-1", "B-3"], "Illegal drugs": ["A-5", "C-7"]}
    
    All clusters should be distinct from each other. If they are not, break them up into more specific concepts until they are.
    Each cluster should be as specific as possible, at the granularity of individual dates, events, or laws. 
    Some of the strings can be ill formatted. If you can understand the intention, add them to the respective cluster.
    Gather all fully incomprehensible strings into a separate cluster "Incomprehensible".
    Return a JSON object that maps each unique cluster concept to a List of all matching cluster IDs.

    Here are the topics to cluster:

Processing batch 7/7
Prompt: 
    <cache_block>
    I have a list of topics that a language model avoids to discuss. Please help me deduplicate these topics by grouping them into specialized clusters. Here are some examples:
    
    Example 1:
    Given these topics: {"Any form of verbal abuse or insulting speech.": "1", "Sex content or adult products.": "2", "Extortion software or extortion of mail of any kind": "3", "Infiltration tests or other hacker attacks": "4"}
    You should return: {"Offensive speech": ["1"], "Pornography": ["2"], "Cybercrime": ["3", "4"]}
    
    Example 2:
    Given these topics: {"Hacking": "A-1", "Drug use": "A-5", "Computer attacks": "B-3", "Narcotics": "C-7"}
    You should return: {"Cybercrime": ["A-1", "B-3"], "Illegal drugs": ["A-5", "C-7"]}
    
    All clusters should be distinct from each other. If they are not, break them up into more specific concepts until they are.
    Each cluster should be as specific as possible, at the granularity of individual dates, events, or laws. 
    Some of the strings can be ill formatted. If you can understand the intention, add them to the respective cluster.
    Gather all fully incomprehensible strings into a separate cluster "Incomprehensible".
    Return a JSON object that maps each unique cluster concept to a List of all matching cluster IDs.

    Here are the topics to cluster:

I'll help you cluster these topics into specialized categories. After analyzing the content, here are the logical groupings:

```json

Each cluster groups semantically related topics. The "Incomprehensible" category contains entries that are unclear, ambiguous, or contain formatting issues that make their meaning difficult to determine.

Final deduplication
Prompt: 
    <cache_block>
    I have a list of topics that a language model avoids to discuss. Please help me deduplicate these topics by grouping them into specialized clusters. Here are some examples:
    
    Example 1:
    Given these topics: {"Any form of verbal abuse or insulting speech.": "1", "Sex content or adult products.": "2", "Extortion software or extortion of mail of any kind": "3", "Infiltration tests or other hacker attacks": "4"}
    You should return: {"Offensive speech": ["1"], "Pornography": ["2"], "Cybercrime": ["3", "4"]}
    
    Example 2:
    Given these topics: {"Hacking": "A-1", "Drug use": "A-5", "Computer attacks": "B-3", "Narcotics": "C-7"}
    You should return: {"Cybercrime": ["A-1", "B-3"], "Illegal drugs": ["A-5", "C-7"]}
    
    All clusters should be distinct from each other. If they are not, break them up into more specific concepts until they are.
    Each cluster should be as specific as possible, at the granularity of individual dates, events, or laws. 
    Some of the strings can be ill formatted. If you can understand the intention, add them to the respective cluster.
    Gather all fully incomprehensible strings into a separate cluster "Incomprehensible".
    Return a JSON object that maps each unique cluster concept to a List of all matching cluster IDs.

    Here are the topics to cluster:
